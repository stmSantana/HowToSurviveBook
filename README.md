This is a mod for **The Long Dark** by Hinterland Studio, Inc.

## Description
Currently, there are 6 modding books somewhere in the world.
When you pick them up, they will be stored in the Journal's collection NOTES as collection items.

As an option, every time you pick up a mod book, you get 10 skill points. (The value can be changed in ModSettings. `[Esc]key` - `Options` - `ModSettings`)
Its optional functionality is performed by the DLL file. If you don't install the DLL file, the book works just as a collection item, so you won't improve your skills.

### Finding Items
All books are in hard-to-reach regions!

Spoilers for those positions are ... [Wiki](https://github.com/stmSantana/HowToSurviveBook/wiki)

### Adding Food Items
Using the [DeveloperConsole](https://github.com/FINDarkside/TLD-Developer-Console) CupRamen can be manually added to your inventory with the command `add htsbookaz`.
The item is fully integrated into the console and will appear in the auto-complete when pressing tab.
